# wildcard_dehydrated_desec
dehydrated Hook for deSEC for wildcard certificates


This is a rip off of https://github.com/franzs/dehydrated_desec  
I couldn't make it work for a wildcard domain.  
I am not a programmer but wanted a wildcard certificate from LetsEncrypt.  
To be frank, I let cursor do the adaption.  
Changes are indicated in the script.  

All this may be wrong, dangerous, insecure, but it works, somehow.
